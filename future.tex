\lettrine[lraise=0.1, nindent=0em, slope=-.5em]{\color{Violet}I}{deas} for improvement are collected during lab sessions, preparation and development phase and big number of smaller proposals makes impossible to list all of them. However, some bigger areas what would influence a future of this particular course or sequel course are listed. Moreover, the critical development proposals for distance laboratory system are enlisted.

Most important problems stayed unresolved with no particular order:
First, Human aspect of the cyber defence - configuring boxes are only one aspect of cyber. 
Second, maintaining central logging and log parsing
Third, installing, and managing a \gls{IDS}/\gls{IPS} system (simpler aspects covered by  \gls{WAF} and \gls{SQL} firewalls in webserver hardening lab.
Fourth, a configuring e-mail system with antivirus, and spam filtering
Fifth, authentication and authorization with Kerberos, LDAP, SAMBA4 domain.
Sixth, the IPv6 is mandatory for newer infrastructure and this need to be implemented into each lab.

Some topics covered are ageing a file server as example. However, the new approaches like OwnCloud private cloud systems are not common today but this may change soon.

The development process of curriculum ends when curriculum itself is obsolete. Therefore additional seminars with partners, other educational institutions and private companies will be carried out. For example the next phase is collect information about Locked Shield 2013 and needed skill set for technicians and also other aspects that system administrators should cope.

Although, a feels that more should be done in the future compared to the work done, all aspects can not be implemented during one e-learning course with load of 6~\gls{ECTS}. Therefore a new areas for possible e-learning courses are listed in Appendix~\ref{Appendix:Lab proposals for the future} on page~\pageref{Appendix:Lab proposals for the future}.

To supporting new scoring system with implementing badge reward system, the virtual laboratory system will redesigned in summer 2013.
