\label{Preliminary Tests}

To gather information about background of the students and distance learner following questions where used (not all questions in every test but subset of them). For students a most of quorum passed the test with more then 50\%. However, in continuous education the precedence is lesser and stays \textasciitilde 10\%. In case of practical test TODO the precedence
